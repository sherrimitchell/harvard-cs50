# Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science
This repository contains all of my problem sets (psets) and solutions for the Harvard CS50 course. Each pset was completed after study of the lectures, shorts, and walkthroughs on the edx site. These psets represent the time and effort that I put into the course, and I received a 100% on each submission which was recorded in the CS50x course gradebook.

The [Harvard CS50](<https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science#!>) course is an introduction to computer science and (the art of) programming. It is designed to help students think algorithmcally and solve problems efficiently. It covers topics including abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. 

## Why I Decided to Take This Course
I have previously completed a backend engineering certification program, and countless hours of self-study. I have some experience as a software engineer, but it has been difficult to secure a full-time position. This repository represents my choice to combat this situation in the way that has always served me best. Learning and working on my skills.
