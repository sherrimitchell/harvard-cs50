## [PSet 2](https://docs.cs50.net/2019/x/psets/2/index.html)

## Objectives:
* Get better acquainted with functions and libraries
* Try your hand at encryption and cryptography

## Problems

[Caesar](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/caesar/)
* Write a program called caesar that enables you to encrypt messages using Caesar’s cipher. Prompt the user for a plaintext message and a numerical key, utilizing the given key encrypt the message using Ceasar's cipher and print the encrypted message.

[Vigenère](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/vigenere/)
 * Write a program called vigenere that enables you to encrypt messages using Vigenère’s cipher. Prompt the user for a plaintext message and a numerical key, utilizing the given key encrypt the message using Vigenère’s cipher and print the encrypted message.
 
[Crack](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/crack/)

  * Design and implement a program, crack, that cracks passwords. Assuming that each password has been hashed with C’s DES-based (not MD5-based) crypt function, the program must proceed to crack the given password as ideally and quickly as possible. The program should accept a hashed password, and return the given password.
